# This repository shows some results of what i learned about "Basic Structure of Image"
On this topic, i learned about:


*   **How computer see an image?**
*   **Formation of a black and white image**: For a black and white image, each pixel is either black or white, represented by numbers where 0 might indicate black and 1 might indicate white. The computer reads these values to create the image.

*   **Formation of an RGB image**: An RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image is formed by combining three different color channels: red, green, and blue. Each pixel in the image is represented by a combination of intensity values for these three colors.
*   **RGB channel separation**

*   **Multispectral imagery**: Multispectral imagery captures data in a few discrete bands within the electromagnetic spectrum, typically ranging from three to ten bands.These bands are usually selected to correspond to specific wavelengths where particular features or materials of interest exhibit unique spectral signatures.Multispectral imagery is commonly used in applications such as land cover classification, agriculture monitoring, and environmental assessment.
*   **Multispectral Bands**: 
Blue (B): Wavelength Range: 450 - 520 nanometers (nm)
Green (G): Wavelength Range: 520 - 600 nm
Red (R): Wavelength Range: 630 - 690 nm
Near Infrared (NIR): Wavelength Range: 750 - 950 nm
SWIR-1: Wavelength Range: 1,350 - 1,750 nm
SWIR-2: Wavelength Range: 1,750 - 2,500 nm
