# Basic-GEE-Practice
# This repository shows some results of my learning about "Basic Structure of Image"
On this topic, i learned about:


*   How we see any object?
*   Light absorbtion and reflection
*   Light absorbtion and reflection by plant
*   Remote sensing
*   Passive remote sensing
*   How computer see an image?
*   Formation of a black and white image

*   Formation of an RGB image
*   RGB channel separation

*   Multispectral imagery
*   Multispectral Bands
*   Multispectral Bands of satellites[The link to an assignment on Three popular satellites](https://github.com/Ashik-Abdullah-Chowdhury/Basic-GEE-Practice/blob/main/Satellite.pdf)
